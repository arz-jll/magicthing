hand testing - Which hands are good, which hands are bad?
    Users- Users own decks, can playtest their decks, they have passwords, emails, change passwords
    Deck- Decks are owned by users, they have a name, a description, a list of Cards
    Cards- Cards are magic cards.
    Decks - Shuffling deck
    Test - A test has 2 hands, the user's preference. WE also want to be able to aggregate these to decide "why" a user prefers some hands. "Left hand is way better, left hand is a little better, about the same..."

UI concerns
    All of these should be single pages, except the test page which will use AJAX
    Paste the decklist from moxfield, then our program will crop out the set name and parse the cards.

Business logic
    Users shouldn't be able to see other users decks or tests.
    We should be able to see "insights" from our tests.
    Being able to share the results of a deck test should be possible, but as read-only!
    (Nice to have) Removing one card from the deck shouldn't invalidate testing.
    Delete/Edit decks, users, should be possible
    "wipe tests"
